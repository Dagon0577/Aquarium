            <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language. It not only absorbs the various advantages of the C++
                language, but also eliminates the concepts of multiple inheritance and pointers that are difficult to
                understand in C++. Therefore, the Java language is powerful and easy to use.</p>
            <p>
                As a representative of static object-oriented programming languages, the Java language implements
                object-oriented theory very well, allowing programmers to perform complex programming in an elegant way.
            </p>

                Java is characterized by simplicity, object-oriented, distributed, robustness, security, platform
                independence and portability, multi-threading, and dynamics. Java can write desktop applications, web
                applications, distributed systems, and embedded system applications.

            <p>The Java Development Kit (JDK) is called a Java development kit or a Java development tool. It is a
                program development environment for writing applet applets and applications.</p>
            <p>The JDK is the core of the entire Java, including the Java Runtime Environment (Java Runtime Envirnment),
                some Java tools and Java's core class library (Java API). No matter what Java application server is
                actually built a certain version of the JDK.</p>
            <p>The mainstream JDK is the JDK released by Sun. In addition to Sun, many companies and organizations have
                developed their own JDKs, such as JDK developed by IBM, Jrocket of BEA, and JDK developed by GNU.</p>
